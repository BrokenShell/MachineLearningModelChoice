# Machine Learning Model Selection

Given a data set how can we select the best model for the job at hand?

1. Define the problem: First, you need to understand the problem you are trying to solve. This will help you determine the type of machine learning problem you are dealing with (e.g., classification, regression, etc.) and the appropriate evaluation metrics to use.
2. Prepare the data: Next, you should preprocess the data and split it into training and testing sets. This will allow you to train and evaluate the performance of different models.
3. Choose a set of models: You can then select a set of candidate models to evaluate. It is a good idea to start with a variety of models and narrow down the selection as you go.
4. Train and evaluate the models: Using scikit-learn, you can train and evaluate the performance of each model on the training data. You should then use the testing data to evaluate the generalization performance of the model.
5. Select the best model: After evaluating the performance of the models, you can select the one that performs the best based on the evaluation metrics you have chosen.
6. Hyperparameters
7. Visualize feature importances, weights and biases
8. CPU usage
9. RAM usage
10. Speed: Time to train and time to predict

It's important to note that this process is not always straightforward and may require some experimentation to find the best model for your dataset. You may also want to consider using cross-validation to get a more robust estimate of model performance.
